##  Description
This project is a Java-based **Student Enrollment System** built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It manages the relationship between students and their respective courses within an academic program.

The system demonstrates key Java concepts:
* **Encapsulation:** Using private fields with public getters and setters to protect data.
* **Constructors:** Initializing objects with specific data (IDs, names, and programs).
* **Class Interactions:** Structuring data models for `Student` and `Course` entities.
